Short term:

1. Pause menu
4. Playtest easy mode 
7. Items in this room counter
when paused, silence music and not reset it
main menu music
fix doooooors

level two:
pressing backspace makes character go back to the beggining of the room
...save option and checkpoints for the rooms (that delete progress of collecting key)
(if you add this, add it to the intro)

you can hear heartbeat through walls


Long term plan:

1. Easy, normal and hard mode (starting with hard and then downgrading or 2 different homes for easy and non-easy).

2. Full UI with compatibility

3. Settings:
	Keyboard/mouse inputs
	
4. Testing

5. Changes based on feedback.
