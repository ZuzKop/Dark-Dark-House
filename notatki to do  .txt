Short term:
 
'Items in this room' counter
when paused, silence music and not reset it
main menu music
fix doooooors
issue: you can hear heartbeat through walls
want: when finishing lvl, 'escape' returns player to main menu instead of pausing

checkpoints:
-collect and open all doors before loaded checkpoints

25: settings, checkpoints -> 90% done <3
26: polish and testing -> send game to testing

Long term plan:

1. Easy, normal and hard mode (starting with hard and then downgrading or 2 different homes for easy and non-easy).

2. Full UI with compatibility

3. Settings:
	Keyboard/mouse inputs
	
4. Testing

5. Changes based on feedback.
